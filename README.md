If you are not a developer, use the above link to access a simple download for the software. 
-------------------------------------

The software is built using Cycling74s 'Max' environment and is licensed under the MPL licence (see LICENCE file), but makes use of third party elements that have their own terms and conditions. See the Manuals, in the 'Manuals' folder for full instructions on installing, third party dependencies and a full description of the system. See the Pop Up Play website for details on the project. 

NB - The main file to open is the Pop-Up-PlayMax.maxpat, the Pop-Up-Play.maxpat is a file used when building an app as it uses da ifferent path managment system. 

-------------------------------------

Version 1 was OpenNI based and built for Mac and Windows, but since Apple aquired OpenNI, the skeletal tracking module (NITE) is no longer legal to use. 
Current version is based on MS Kinect libraries, exposed by the dp.kinect object https://hidale.com/product-category/software/ (which has its own terms and conditions inside the dp.kinect folder and requires a purchased registration file to function). Therefore, full functionality of the software is currently only supported by Windows in a legally compliant way, but the OpenNI elements and Mac functionality remain in case an alternative to NITE is found.
